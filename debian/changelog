opus (1.3~beta+20180518-1) unstable; urgency=medium

opus (1.3~beta+20180516-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Snapshot from 652c4559f593d3aad78bd5c85a216eeae7859429 as a preview of
    patches pending for the 1.3 release.  The main motivation for doing this
    now is to pull in the fix for the PLC regression introduced just before
    1.2~alpha2, which Closes: #898690, and to get some broader testing on the
    new hardening checks before flipping the switch to enable those by default
    upstream.
  * Fix celt_pitch_xcorr() ARM jump table compiling error for a bug introduced
    in 1.2-rc1.
  * Better rate allocation for stereo SILK in hybrid mode.
  * Add RNN for VAD and speech/music classification.
  * Fixing bandwidth detection for 24 kHz analysis.
  * Enable RFC 8251 changes by default.
  * Better tuning for low-bitrate music.
  * Don't set _FORTIFY_SOURCE and -fstack-protector as part of the packaging
    anymore, the upstream build system will add them where they are supported
    and needed now.
  * Build with --enable-hardening, which isn't related to the compile options
    above, but instead includes additional opus-specific runtime sanity checks
    which are cheap and certain enough to use in production builds.
  * Use dh compat 9, not because it actually brings anything new which we need
    here, but it hushes the increasingly insistent warnings about deprecated
    compat levels, and is a baseline supported by all of the releases we still
    need to be able to support.  I'm going to say this Closes: #810258, since
    the rest of the 'modernisation' there mostly isn't helpful.  We've already
    been running the tests since the very first release, we release directly
    from upstream git and maintain upstream patches there, so format 3(quilt)
    adds nothing but pain, and we have upstream build and install targets that
    are designed to cleanly separate the -arch specific and -indep components,
    so regressing to make those codependent isn't very appealing either.  It
    would have also broken support for building where m-a wasn't supported,
    though that's less of a problem today than it was previously.

opus (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixes a bug in surround encoding causing very bad quality on loud signals
    beyond a certain amplitude.
  * Speech quality improvements especially in the 12-24 kbit/s range.
  * Music quality improvements in the 32-48 kb/s range.
  * More aggressive use of wider speech bandwidth, including fullband speech
    starting at 14 kbit/s.
  * Improved VBR encoding for hybrid mode.
  * SILK CBR improvements.
  * DTX support for CELT mode.
  * Support for directly encoding packets up to 120 ms.
  * Improves quality on files with powerful tones that cause MDCT leakage.
  * Fixes for speech/music detection at the very beginning of files.
  * Fixes an issue where the encoder can misdetect that the signal is SWB
    instead of FB, lowpassing the signal.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Sep 2017 01:48:45 +0930

opus (1.2~alpha2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Run the tonality analysis at 24 kHz, which reduces complexity while giving
    better frequency resolution for the tonality estimate.
  * Speech quality improvements especially in the 12-20 kbit/s range.
  * Improved VBR encoding for hybrid mode.
  * More aggressive use of wider speech bandwidth, including fullband speech
    starting at 14 kbit/s.
  * Music quality improvements in the 32-48 kb/s range.
  * Generic and SSE CELT optimizations.
  * Support for directly encoding packets up to 120 ms.
  * DTX support for CELT mode.
  * SILK CBR improvements.
  * Ensure that NLSF cannot be negative when computing a min distance between
    them.  This was reported and fixed in July, and assessed as having only a
    relatively minor impact (garbage output, from the garbage input needed to
    trigger it), or at very worst, an assertion failure or simple crash from
    a slightly out of bounds read.  In December it was assigned CVE-2017-0381
    by someone other than the upstream developers, with claims of it being a
    'Critical' issue on Android, but we're yet to see any analysis to back
    that up.  Closes: #851612

  * Preview snapshot of the 1.1 release.  Mostly to give people who need some
    of the newer API functions for their own projects something to play with
    while we finalise the rest of what is planned for this one.
    The encoder should perform better (both for quality and bitrate) than the
    1.0.x releases, but please do report any regressions you find upstream
    so that they can be fixed.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2011 18:31:33 +0930

celt (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "correlation does not imply causation" release.
    To celebrate the first release of celt that is actually compatible with a
    a previously distributed version, we've renamed the library!
  * libcelt is now libcelt0.  The intent from upstream being to make it clear
    that one of the above was an accident, and unlikely to be repeated soon.
    On the bright side, this means we should be getting proper soname bumps
    from now on when the code ABI changes.  The bitstream format still remains
    entirely fluid though, applications which communicate with a peer _must_
    check that the formats are compatible at runtime.  It may, and indeed is
    very likely to, continue changing with every release.
  * By some small miracle, this should be an entirely painless transition
    though.  The new package doesn't conflict with the existing one, and all
    rdeps except mumble will switch to the new package with a binNMU, but not
    be broken in the meantime.  They use the .pc file provided, and have been
    build tested.  The mumble package is waiting on this one before it can work
    properly anyway, so a fix for that is just waiting for this to get through
    the NEW queue first now.
  * The new PLC is reported to be working Really Well.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Jan 2010 18:31:33 +1030

celt (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another day, another bitstream format.  Closes: #554559
  * Drop the IETF drafts for now.  Better to leave worrying about the
    paperwork for this until we have some documents that aren't actually
    supposed to expire in less than the life of a distro release.
    Closes: #538990 for now.  If you really need to reference them, then
    you should probably be tracking git anyhow, as they should be changing
    while the codec evolves too.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 07 Nov 2009 17:48:35 +1030
